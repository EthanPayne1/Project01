Created the skeleton structure for the project.
I chose this format because it's the same project structure that I use at work.

### 02/14/25, 5:35pm CST
Wrote the build instruction for my CMakeLists.txt files and added my default build script to compiling everything. 
Ideally, I want to add a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build&test process but I need to write the actual code first. 

### 02/17/25, CST 
Worked on a prototype for the logger but I think I'll try something better later on.

### 02/18/25, 
Wrote another implementation of my logger header because I don't have faith in the orginal.
At some point today I want to work on the ecrpytion but I think digital logic prelab might take a long time to finish.
